summary: This project was completed for project 3 of Engineering 1P13. My team's main focus was to improve Canada's waste management system. To increase the number of plastics that get recycled, my team worked on a given facility to organize, sort, and dispose of waste in its appropriate recycling bin. As a computing sub-team member, I focused on creating efficient code to operate the facility on Quanser Labs simulator.

• Designed an effective method to sort, and dispose incoming waste in Python to increase the number of items that can be recycled by a factor of 1.5 <br />
• Developed a function that will automatically correct the relative orientation and position of the Q-bot to minimize the error of moving parts in the system <br />
