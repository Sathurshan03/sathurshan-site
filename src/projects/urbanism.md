summary: Final group project for 2AA4 that lasted for 3 months. This project is about randomly generating an island map with features such as lakes, rivers, elevation, humidity, and biomes. The island map generator is determinitic by a seed and is realistic as rivers flow down due to decreasing elevation. There are also cities on the map which are all connected via a star network. My groupmates were Nirmal Chaudhari and Mithun Paramathasan.

• Took responsibility as project manager to ensure that everyone was on schedule and team met weekly deliverables <br />
• A variety of islands can be generated as many biomes, shapes, and elevation pattern options are available <br />
• Our generated maps were chosen to be shared on McMaster Engineering's Twitter page  <br />
• Generalized code which allowed the team to reuse many objects and saved time coding <br />
