summary: I participated in Hack the North 2022 to explore my passion for computing. For three days straight, my team developed a site where an individual can perform a semantic search on research papers in PDF format. A semantic search is a search based on meaning rather than exact words. This site will help students and researchers to search more effectively through papers and save time reading.
